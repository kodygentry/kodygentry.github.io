# Kody Gentry Portfolio

Welcome to my portfolio website! This site showcases my work in game development and software projects.

## Project Overview

- **Home (index.html):**  
  A landing page with a hero section featuring interactive particle animations and navigation to other sections.

- **Games (games.html):**  
  A dedicated page for my game projects, including demos and links to play or view details on external platforms.

- **Software (software.html):**  
  A page featuring my software projects with details and links to GitHub repositories.

- **Responsive Design:**  
  The website is designed to work across desktop and mobile devices. Media queries adjust the layout (especially the project cards) for smaller screens.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML5 & CSS3:**  
  For structure and styling.
  
- **JavaScript:**  
  For interactive elements such as animations, a Tic-Tac-Toe AI demo, and a Conwayâ€™s Game of Life simulation.

- **Canvas API:**  
  Used for particle animations and demos.
